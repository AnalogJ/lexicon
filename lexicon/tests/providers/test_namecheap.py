"""
A note about running these tests against the live environment

1.  Namecheap offers a Testing Sandbox for their API.
    You must create an account on `sandbox.namecheap.com`, then "apply" for API
    access. It is supposed to be issued automatically, but you will most-likely
    need to ask their support to approve API access on the test system. You can
    do this via their LiveChat

    https://www.namecheap.com/support/api/methods.aspx

2.  There are two variants of the test:
    * NamecheapProviderTests
    * NamecheapManagedProviderTests

    Namecheap acts a little differently for "owned" vs "managed" domains, so a
    secondary test run must be done.

To set enable live testing against the actual API:

* Create two (2) Sandbox accounts on Namecheap
* Using the First Account:
    *   Enable API access
    *   "Purchase" a first test domain for use on `NamecheapProviderTests`.
        This will be the env variable `LEXICON_NAMECHEAP_DOMAIN`
* Using the Second Account:
    *   "Purchase" a second test domain for use on `NamecheapManagedProviderTests`.
        This will be the env variable `LEXICON_NAMECHEAP_DOMAINMANAGED`
    *   Using the Namecheap dashboard, "share" the domain management with the
        first user.
*   The First account will then get an email to "accept" the domain management
    invitation from the Second account.
*   All API tests occure on the First account
*   Note: Namecheap's API requires the client's IP address to be whitelisted.

The required Environment Variables for a live test are:

    export LEXICON_NAMECHEAP_TOKEN={TOKEN}
    export LEXICON_NAMECHEAP_USERNAME={USERNAME}
    export LEXICON_NAMECHEAP_DOMAIN={DOMAIN_1}
    export LEXICON_NAMECHEAP_DOMAINMANAGED={DOMAIN_2}
